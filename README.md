You can use this Java client library to add [Nexmo's API](#api-coverage) to your application. To use this, you'll
need a Nexmo account. Sign up [for free at nexmo.com][signup].

## Installation

To use the client library you'll need to have [created a Nexmo account][signup].

### Gradle

To install the Java client library using Gradle, add the following to `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.nexmo:client:2.0.2'
}
```

### Maven

Add the following to the correct place in your project's POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
      <groupId>com.nexmo</groupId>
      <artifactId>client</artifactId>
      <version>2.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Build It Yourself

Alternatively you can clone the repo and build the JAR file yourself:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nexmo/nexmo-java.git
gradle build
```

### Download everything in a ZIP file

**Note**: We *strongly recommend* that you use a tool that supports dependency management, such as [Gradle], [Maven],
or [Ivy]

We provide a [ZIP file for each release](https://github.com/Nexmo/nexmo-java/releases/),
containing the client library JAR, along with all the dependencies. Download the file, unzip it, and add the JAR files
to your project's classpath.

[Gradle]: https://gradle.org/
[Maven]: https://maven.apache.org/
[Ivy]: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/


## Usage

Check the [Javadoc](http://nexmo.github.io/nexmo-java/) for full
reference documentation. There are also many useful code samples in the [nexmo-community/nexmo-java-quickstart](https://github.com/nexmo-community/nexmo-java-quickstart) repository.


### Examples

The following code initiates an outbound call which then reads the user [a message](https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/first_call_talk.json):

```java
import java.nio.file.Paths;

import com.nexmo.client.NexmoClient;
import com.nexmo.client.auth.JWTAuthMethod;
import com.nexmo.client.voice.Call;
import com.nexmo.client.voice.CallEvent;

JWTAuthMethod auth = new JWTAuthMethod(application_id, Paths.get("application_key.pem"));
NexmoClient client = new NexmoClient(auth);
Call call = new Call(to, from,
                     "https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/first_call_talk.json");
CallEvent event = client.getVoiceClient().createCall(call);
```

After the call is answered, you can get more information about it, including
the amount it cost with:

```java
CallInfo info = client.getVoiceClient().getCallDetails(event.getUuid());
System.out.println("This cost: " + info.getPrice() + " EUR");
```

You can modify an existing call in progress, for example by hanging up on the current call:

```java
ModifyCallResponse modifyResponse = client.getVoiceClient().modifyCall(event.getUuid(), "hangup");
System.out.println(modifyResponse.getMessage());
```

While a call is in progress, you can send Dual-tone multi-frequency(DTMF) tones like so:

```java
DtmfResponse dtmfResponse = client.getVoiceClient().sendDtmf(event.getUuid(), "332393");
System.out.println("Success! " + dtmfResponse.getMessage());
```

To stream an audio file to an active call, simply use the following method:

```java
StreamResponse startStreamResponse = client.getVoiceClient().startStream(event.getUuid(), "https://nexmo-community.github.io/ncco-examples/assets/voice_api_audio_streaming.mp3");
System.out.println("Success! " + startStreamResponse.getMessage());
```

If you'd like to stop streaming an audio file to an active call, you can do so with:
```java
StreamResponse stopStreamResponse = client.getVoiceClient().stopStream(event.getUuid());
System.out.println("Alright. " + stopStreamResponse.getMessage());
```

To send a synthesized speech message to an active call, just use the following method:

```java
TalkResponse startTalkResponse = client.getVoiceClient().startTalk(event.getUuid(), "Hello World");
System.out.println("Success! " + startTalkResponse.getMessage());
```

If you'd like to stop sending a synthesized speech message to an active call, you can do so with:
```java
TalkResponse stopTalkResponse = client.getVoiceClient().stopTalk(event.getUuid());
System.out.println("Alright. " + stopTalkResponse.getMessage());
```
